        <h1>Composting Guide with Organic Waste Produced at Home</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Composting is a fantastic way to manage organic waste produced at home and create valuable compost for your garden. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a compost bin, select materials, and maintain your compost effectively.</p>

                <div class="step-number">Step 1:</div>
                <h3>Setting Up Your Compost Bin</h3>
                <p>Choose a suitable location for your compost bin. It should be in a shaded area with good drainage. You can use a commercial compost bin or make your own using wooden pallets, wire mesh, or a simple plastic container.</p>

                <h3>Selecting Materials</h3>
                <p>Compost requires a balance of 'greens' (nitrogen-rich materials) and 'browns' (carbon-rich materials). Greens include fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. Browns include dry leaves, cardboard, and paper. Aim for a ratio of 2-3 parts browns to 1 part greens.</p>

                <div class="step-number">Step 3:</div>
                <h3>Adding Materials to the Bin</h3>
                <p>Start by adding a layer of coarse materials like twigs or straw at the bottom of the bin. Then, alternate layers of greens and browns, ensuring each layer is relatively even. Avoid adding meat, dairy, and oily foods to prevent odors and pests.</p>

                <div class="step-number">Step 4:</div>
                <h3>Maintaining Your Compost</h3>
                <p>Turn the compost regularly to aerate it and speed up decomposition. Keep the compost moist but not too wet. If the compost is too dry, add water; if too wet, add more browns to absorb excess moisture.</p>

                <div class="step-number">Step 5:</div>
                <h3>Harvesting Compost</h3>
                <p>After a few months, the compost will become dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling. This indicates it's ready to use. Remove the finished compost from the bottom of the bin and use it to enrich your garden soil.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Greens and Browns</h2>
                <p><strong>Greens:</strong> Nitrogen-rich materials such as fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. These are usually moist and help to provide the necessary nutrients for the composting process.</p>
                <p><strong>Browns:</strong> Carbon-rich materials such as dry leaves, straw, cardboard, and paper. These are typically dry and help to balance the compost mix, providing structure and aiding in airflow.</p>
                <p>Maintaining the right balance between greens and browns is crucial for effective composting. Aim for a ratio of 2-3 parts browns to 1 part greens.</p>
